# markdownLatexPDF

The goal of this project is to smooth some of the rough edges of writing academic papers through the use of multimarkdown and latex and smooth some of the rough edges of dealing with those.  

1. Install $\LaTeX$ and Bib$\TeX$:

   Mac$\TeX$ (a latex package with everything you could ever need) is available here: http://www.tug.org/mactex/

2. Install multimarkdown 5, available here: https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-5/releases/download/5.4.0/MultiMarkdown-Mac-5.4.0.dmg

3. Get the files from here

4. Optional: Download the multimarkdown template files: https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown-latex-support

5. Run the folder moving script while the folder you download from here is in your downloads folder or do it manually. 

   (If you use the script it will give you the option to create a shortcut on your desktop. This is useful while you calibrate your .tex template files to your liking)

6. Install the service

The template files go into your hidden library directory under the home folder. To view it press <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> while in your home folder. 

Folder Structure:

The .tex files themselves will go into your mmd folder. The .bib file goes in the bib folder. If you make any .cls files, they can go in the latex folder.
